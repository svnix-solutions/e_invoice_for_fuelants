## Einvoice For Fuelants

e-Invoicing for fuelants streamlines fuel transaction management by automating GST-compliant invoicing and connecting directly to e-Invoice registration portals. With this feature, users can configure fuel items, set up GST details, and automatically calculate taxes based on item specifications. Each e-Invoice generates an IRN (Invoice Reference Number) and a QR code upon submission, meeting regulatory standards. Additionally, ERPNext provides downloadable PDFs for easy record-keeping, along with automated reports to track invoice status and ensure compliance. This setup minimizes manual data entry and enhances efficiency for organizations handling high-volume fuel transactions.
